### Important elements:
- Image
- Name
- Price
- Season you want to buy
- Product link
- Importance
- Justification
- Mark as purchased

### More complex and not so necessary:
- Show total sum
- Show total price of already purchased
- Show future expenses
- Create graphs with purchase values
- Purchase theme
- Tags
- Maybe a price tracking (look at zoom APIs, Buscap√©, etc.)
- Make a TUI version
- Export as table and maybe markdown
- Automate backup
- Android application if development is finished
